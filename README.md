# Heart-Quotes
The quotes do not have to come from old books, sages or saints. You can get inspiration for quotes from anything, such
as lines in a movie, lyrics in music, conversations with someone, interviews with F1 racers, and lines in games.</p>
Quotes are short, but it should be a process that is engraved in the mind for a long time. So let us show it slowly. I
hope it is not a moment that is consumed quickly.
